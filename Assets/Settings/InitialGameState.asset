    - You eventually arrive after a long hike through the desolate landscape of the
      kingdoms east, where the Sevenjag mountain range looms on the horizon. Your
      rations are almost fully depleted.\nAfter looking around for an hour, you still
      come up empty, already silently cursing the old fool who sold you the treasure
      map.\nBut then you finally stumble upon it, almost dropping down its gaping
      entrance.\n\nYou found a hole in the ground.
