    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You stand at the edge of the hole. Below you is a gaping abyss of
      darkness and intrigue.\nIt smells of old fur and damp earth. You hope it is
      abandoned.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: As you descend into the earth below, the air changes subtly. After
      a while you find some recent animal carcasses strewn around.\nThe smell is
      horridly rancid and it permeates your surroundings.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You fight lots of rats and vermin. They contaminate these tunnels
      like a disease. The stench of rot is omnipresent. Between the various new and
      old bones you find small trinkets.\nGolden rings, bracelets, a necklace here
      and there.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: The bones you find even deeper in the burrow are clearly humanoid.\nWhatever
      lived here before the rats came, hunted many a victim from the surrounding
      homesteads. And after it left, the vermin took its home for themselves.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: The Burrow extends deeper and deeper into the earth. The return
      trups are ever longer. It seems like, whatever monstrous being lived here in
      the past did not come from the surface world but rather from deep down below
      the earth, making its way upwards

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You finally arrive at the heart of its nest. A giant chamber filled
      with old straw and clothes, resembling a makeshift bed.\nAll around you are
      piles and piles of bones. The treasure here in plentiful though and it will
      take a while to carry it all back.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: Even deeper still you can go. You wander the paths of old, where
      the ancient beast burrowed upwards. Soon after, the mud receeds and you find
      stone and rock in its place. Maybe you will someday see the place where this
      being came from.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: The light of your lantern reflects pale gray stone. In front of
      you, primeval monuments of ancient wilderness stretch up into the cavernous
      air.\nDead, hardened and preserved for all eternity. A giant underground forest.
      How peculiar.
