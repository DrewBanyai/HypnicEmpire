    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You stand at the edge of the hole. Below you is a gaping abyss of

      abandoned.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: As you descend into the earth below, the air changes subtly. After
      a while you find some recent animal carcasses strewn around.\nThe smell is
      horridly rancid and it permeates your surroundings.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You fight lots of rats and vermin. They contaminate these tunnels
      like a disease. The stench of rot is omnipresent. Between the various new and
      old bones you find small trinkets.\nGolden rings, bracelets, a necklace here
      and there.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: The bones you find even deeper in the burrow are clearly humanoid.\nWhatever
      lived here before the rats came, hunted many a victim from the surrounding
      homesteads. And after it left, the vermin took its home for themselves.
