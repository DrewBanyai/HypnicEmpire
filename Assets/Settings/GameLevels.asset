    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You stand at the edge of the hole. Below you is a gaping abyss of
      darkness and intrigue.\nIt smells of old fur and damp earth. You hope it is
      abandoned.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: As you descend into the earth below, the air changes subtly. After
      a while you find some recent animal carcasses strewn around.\nThe smell is
      horridly rancid and it permeates your surroundings.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You fight lots of rats and vermin. They contaminate these tunnels
      like a disease. The stench of rot is omnipresent. Between the various new and
      old bones you find small trinkets.\nGolden rings, bracelets, a necklace here
      and there.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: The bones you find even deeper in the burrow are clearly humanoid.\nWhatever
      lived here before the rats came, hunted many a victim from the surrounding
      homesteads. And after it left, the vermin took its home for themselves.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: The Burrow extends deeper and deeper into the earth. The return
      trups are ever longer. It seems like, whatever monstrous being lived here in
      the past did not come from the surface world but rather from deep down below
      the earth, making its way upwards

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: You finally arrive at the heart of its nest. A giant chamber filled
      with old straw and clothes, resembling a makeshift bed.\nAll around you are
      piles and piles of bones. The treasure here in plentiful though and it will
      take a while to carry it all back.

    Name: Animal Burrow
    Description: Even deeper still you can go. You wander the paths of old, where
      the ancient beast burrowed upwards. Soon after, the mud receeds and you find
      stone and rock in its place. Maybe you will someday see the place where this
      being came from.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: The light of your lantern reflects pale gray stone. In front of
      you, primeval monuments of ancient wilderness stretch up into the cavernous
      air.\nDead, hardened and preserved for all eternity. A giant underground forest.
      How peculiar.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: Here and there you can pick up individual branches from the ground.
      They are as heavy as rock and just as scrawny, but can still be used as building
      material. A shame to just leave them lying around, these pieces of former titans.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: You come across a clearing. Brittle stone breaks under your soles.
      The ceiling is several meters high. However, even here everything is petrified.\nEven
      the young shoots that probably sprouted eternities ago at the side of their
      elders are devoid of life.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: Another turn through the forgotten forest. Then you stumble upon
      something you didn't expect to find here. Between the trunks of stony trees
      you discover a single, but definitely very fossilized shoe that must have once
      been made of leather.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: Soon you discover more and more remnants of habitation. A shattered
      hoe, turned to rock. A cart with broken stone wheels. A statue of a horse.
      Then a statue of a human. Then another. And still more. Fleeing from something
      eons ago.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: Finally, you stand in the middle of a small buried village. The
      once wooden huts turned to dark rock. In the middle lies a monster that has
      turned to stone by its own gaze. At its side, the brave young girl who tricked
      it with a mirror.\nAll without life. Only gravel remains.

    Name: Petrified Forest
    Description: You bury their remains as best you can. You smash the monster to
      dust. The sight of it shall never harm anyone again.\nThe air is filled with
      the finest of powders. You sneeze. Once. Twice. Then silence falls upon you
      once again.

    Name: Abandoned Mineshaft
    Description: The next path into the depths you find at the edge of the petrified
      village. Before its misfortune, the people had dug a mine. The cold, wood-supported
      walls feel pleasant on your skin. No ore is left. The earth lies bare and empty
      before you.

    Name: Abandoned Mineshaft
    Description: Here and there you find some metal or a gemstone that you can sell.
      However, it doesn't take long before you come across the first skeletons. Some
      of them have weapons stuck in them. Others died merely from sharp sticks.\nBut
      all of them are long dead

    Name: Abandoned Mineshaft
    Description: The deeper you go, the more carnage you find. Battles that raged
      in the distant past, where several different parties fought in crowded corridors.
      Some of them have worn long red robes, which now hang only in tatters on their
      bones. They vaguely resemble religious attire.

    Name: Abandoned Mineshaft
    Description: In front of you stands a small alter, roughly build ages ago from
      now rotten wood and loose bone. Ancient script is scribbled frantically across
      its surface. A skeleton rests on it, one hand still clasped around the dagger
      handle with which they took their own life.

    Name: Abandoned Mineshaft
    Description: A primitive chapel was set up in one of the larger mine corridors.
      A dozen pews full of sitting skeletons in front of an idol smeared with dried
      red paint.\nThey seem to have died peacefully at least. Or at least were unknowingly
      poisoned.

    Name: Abandoned Mineshaft
    Description: You reach one of the last paths, at one of the deepest places of
      the mine. One one of the supports hangs a birdcage with half-crumbled bird
      bones in it. Nearby lies a pickaxe and a single wide gaping crack in the rock.\nBehind
      it, an empty air pocket.

    Name: Crystal Caverns
    Description: After leaving the mine behind you, lantern raised high, you now
      see the soft glow of light ahead of you in the darkness.\nAfter a few moments,
      the passage widens into a grandiose cave, filled with blue glowing crystals.
      They are stunningly beautiful.

    Name: Crystal Caverns
    Description: After a while you notice that flowers grow at the feet or at least
      near the crystals. Their inconspicuous azure appearance somehow has a calming,
      almost soporific effect. You yawn once, heartily.

    Name: Crystal Caverns
    Description: Your pace slows down and your eyelids get heavier. you now have
      to fight hard for every step. Apparently the efforts of the last weeks were
      a bit too much. A little nap would be just the right thing now. It couldn't
      hurt, now could it?

    Name: Crystal Caverns
    Description: Finally, you simply can't take it anymore. With a dull sound, your
      body topples forward onto the hard stone floor. Your eyelids finally begin
      to close. But shortly before that, your tired gazy catches one of the azure
      flowers on the wayside. And the ashen skull lying next to it.

    Name: Crystal Caverns
    Description: Ignoring any scratches, you dash through the luminous caverns. How
      could you be so foolish, you think. Where else would the little flowers down
      here get their nutrients from. You protect your face with you coat from the
      now seemingly menacing light.

    Name: Crystal Caverns
    Description: Exhausted and out of breath, you turn the last corner and almost
      run into a gray rock wall. Finally, you are surrounded by darkness again. You
      pull out your lantern. Down here, you have to be cautious even in such graceful
      looking places. A lesson you will not forget so quickly.

    Description: The air becomes damp, as you step deeper. After turning around the

      and rotten swamp. Every step you take squelches with wetness. How can this
      all thrive here in the darkness?

    Description: Every now and then you find some gold and silver in the brackish

      the worse the stench gets.
