    m_values:
    - You eventually arrive after a long hike through the desolate landscape of the
      kingdoms east, where the Sevenjag mountain range looms on the horizon. Your
      rations are almost fully depleted.\nAfter looking around for an hour, you still
      come up empty, already silently cursing the old fool who sold you the treasure
      map.\nBut then you finally stumble upon it, almost dropping down its gaping
      entrance.\n\nYou found a hole in the ground.
    - You found a varied assortment of foods in the surrounding underbrush. While
      looking for a snack you also gathered a tiny amount of medicinal herbs.\nThey
      could be useful in the future.
    - Slowly you are getting the hang of it. The area around the hole is full of
      berry bushes and tiny wild carrots. Enough for a hearty soup at least.
    - The nearby villagers eye you suspiciously. The people here can barely survive
      on what the acidic soil produces.\nThey take your riches, but would much rather
      buy some of your food.\nNot what you wanted, but at least a start.
    - After a while, your new wild gardens stand in full bloom. Foraging is also
      now way easier, thanks to all the paths you made through previous runs.
    - 'You indeed sampled a lot of herbs. After that, you also sampled quite a lot
      together from the pantry. All in all, it was a very smoke afternoon. '
